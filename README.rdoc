= diMLOrb

*diMLOrb* is a gem that helps you programmatically grab the timetables of the Metro Ligero Oeste (MLO) in the Madrid Community.

*diMLOrb* is mainly web scraping the MLO official website (diMLO): http://www.dimlo.es/Informate/calc.aspx

I just did this little tool in order to have a single click app in my iphone to check the timetable of the train I have to get everyday. For that purpose I created http://dimloya.heroku.com/ which uses this gem.

Currently my little website _diMLOya_ supports only 2 stations of all the network. If someone is ever interested in having support for the whole nextwork I would be more than happy to finish the job, until then I'll leave it like that (I'm a lazy guy :P)

Note that this gems depends on the diMLO website which oftenly tends to be down or not responsive.


= Example of Usage
    require 'diMLOrb'
    #say I want to go from Pozuelo Oeste station to Colonia JardÃ­n station
    d = DiMLOrb::DiMLOrb.new(:PozueloOeste, :ColoniaJardin)
    d.proximo   # => (in minutes) amount of time first  train will take to get to Pozuelo Oeste
    d.siguiente # => (in minutes) amount of time second train will take to get to Pozuelo Oeste
    d.duracion  # => (in minutes) amount of time it will take the train to get from Pozuelo Oeste to Colonia Jardin

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
